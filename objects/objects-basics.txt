ABOUT: Object oriented programming is a very common form of programming and consists of objects filled with data
An object can be whatever you want it to be and can contain as many variables as you want of any type you want
To declare an object, you must first create a class, and you do it like this "class name_of_class:"

Constructor:
Inside the class, you must have what is called a constructor, and this will allow you to set all the variables inside the object
To create the constructor, simply type this inside the class
def __init__(self, variableA, variableB):
	self.variableA = variableA
	self.variableB = variableB

Counter:
Another common attribute give to every class is a counter
This will count the amount of objects you have declared of a class
To add this simply add this into your class "name_of_counter = 0" and inside the constructor add "name_of_class.name_of_counter+=1"

Initialization:
To initiate the object simply do "name_of_object = name_of_class("whatever you want to set variableA as", "whatever you want to set variableB as")"
You can have other functions inside the object that do whatever you want and you can call them by doing this "name_of_object.name_of_function()"

DIRECTIONS: Make an object with a minumum of two variables with more than two types of variables, a constructor, a counter and a function that displays the variables of the object

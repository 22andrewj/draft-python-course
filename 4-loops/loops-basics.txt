ABOUT: In most programming languages there are 3 main types of loops.

For Loop:
Probably the most common loop, the for loop allows you to go from one number to another. 
To call a for loop, you can do "for x in range(0, 10):" and x will loop from 0 to 10. 
If you want the loop to increase by a certain number, you can add an extra paramter to the range function that sets what number it increases by. 
For example, "for x in range(0,10,2):" will loop from 0 to 10 and increase by 2.
This is useful if you want to repeat a task with an increasing value.

While Loop:
While loops, instead of looping through a range of numbers, only loops while a boolean statement is true.
To call a while loop, simply type "while():" and inside the parentheses insert a boolean statement.
For example, if you type "while(true):" the loop will always be running since the boolean statement will always be true.

Foreach Loops:
Foreach loops are simple loops that loop through a list.
To use foreach loops, similar to for loops, type "for x in list:" assuming list is already declared as a list.
In this example, x will represent the various items inside the list, and the loop will run through every item in the list.

DIRECTIONS: Using what you've learned from the previous lessons, you're going to be making three distinct function:

First function:
The first function, you will be printing random numbers from 0 to 10 using the randint(a, b) function that gives you a random int depending on the parameters you put in.
The loop will stop once the code prints the number 5.

Second function:
For the second function, you're going to want to loop through the numbers from 0 to 100 and only print the prime numbers.

Third function:
For the thir function, you're going to want to loop through the list "collectives" (already declared) and only print the strings in the list that start out with a "b" or "B".

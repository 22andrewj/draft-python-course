ABOUT: Math is a vital part of programming and allows you to perform a variety of functions
Math in Python works the same as in real life (e.g. 2 + 2 will return 4), but a few operators might be a bit trickier to use in python
To perform these functions, you're going to need to import the math library (it's already been imported into math-basics.py)

Module: Module is a commonly used function in programming
It's represented using a percentage sign (%) and gives you the remainder of two numbers
For example, 5 % 2 would be equal to 1 since the remainder of 5 divided by 2 is 1

Absolute: To get the absolute value of a number, you can use the abs(number) function where you insert the number you want to get the absolute value from into the function
For example abs(5 - 6) would return 1 since the absolute value of 5 - 6 is 1

Power: To get a raised to the power of b, you're going to have to use the math library, more specifically, the pow function
You must insert two variables into the function
For example math.pow(2,3) would return 2 raised to the power of 3, which is 8

Square Root: Once again, you're going to have to use a function from the math library to get the square root of a number
The sqrt(x) functions returns the square root of x
For example, math.sqrt(16) would return the square root of 16, which is 4 

DIRECTIONS: Make 8 different functions, 4 for the standard arithmatic operators (+,-,*,/) and one for the functions listed above
So for example, the addition function you will be making should accept in two parameters and return the sum of the two parameters

DIRECTIONS: For this lesson, you're going to make 4 functions

First function: For the first function, you're going to want to run through the 2D array "collectives" (already declared) and print out every string that has a "p" or a "P" in the beginning.

Second function: For the second function, you're going to print out a stair of asteriks.
The function will have 1 parameter what will determine the size of the stairs.
So for example, if the I insert three as the size, this should be printed out.
*
**
***

Third function: The third function will just be the second function but inverted, so if I call the function with a size of three, the output should be:
***
**
*

Fourth function: The fourth function will print out a pyramid of asteriks.
Similair to the second and third function, the fourth function will have one parameter that determines the size of the pyramid.
So if I set the size as 3, this should be the output:
*
**
*

Extra: Remake the 2nd, 3rd and 4th function but instead of asteriks, have a string.
For example, if the string is "coding", these should the respective outcomes.

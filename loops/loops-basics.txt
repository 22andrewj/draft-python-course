DIRECTIONS: Using what you've learned from the previous lessons, you're going to be making three distinct function:

First function:
The first function, you will be printing random numbers from 0 to 10 using the randint(a, b) function that gives you a random int depending on the parameters you put in.
The loop will stop once the code prints the number 5.

Second function:
For the second function, you're going to want to loop through the numbers from 0 to 100 and only print the prime numbers.

Third function:
For the third function, you're going to want to loop through the list "collectives" (already declared) and only print the strings in the list that start out with a "b" or "B".
